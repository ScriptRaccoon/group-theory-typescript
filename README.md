# Group theory in TypeScript

This repository develops [group theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory) with the help of generic classes in TypeScript. The material is explained on my blog.

The main file is `src/index.ts` which imports all examples and tests them.

## Commands

-   `npm install` installs the dependencies
-   `npm run dev:ts` compiles and bundles the TypeScript code during development
-   `npm run dev:node` executes and watches the bundled JavaScript file during development
-   `npm run build` builds the JavaScript file for production
